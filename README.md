# PCC Language (Procedural-Compressed-Code)

## Revolutionary AI-Native Programming Language

PCC is an ultra-compressed programming language designed for maximum efficiency in AI-generated code. Programs are written directly as AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes, eliminating parsing overhead and achieving alien-like compression ratios.

### Key Features

- **Direct AST Programming**: No parsing - write AST nodes directly
- **Ultra-Compressed**: Maximum semantic density per byte
- **AI-Native**: Optimized for LLM code generation and evolution
- **Agent-Driven Development**: Evolved by competing AI agents
- **Pure VM Execution**: Standalone interpreter with no dependencies

### Goals

1. **AAA Games in Seconds**: Ultra-compressed game code generation
2. **Agent Evolution**: Self-improving agent-generated programs  
3. **Maximum Efficiency**: Alien-like programming paradigms
4. **Pure Architecture**: No legacy human-designed constraints

### Status

ðŸš§ **Active Development** - Extracting from Godot to pure standalone VM

### Philosophy

This is not just another programming language. PCC represents a fundamental shift toward AI-native code that operates at compression ratios impossible for human-written programs.
