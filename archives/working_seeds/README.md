# Working Seed Files Archive

This directory preserves the 2 working planet generation seeds that were analyzed and integrated into the unified system.

## Archived Files

### Seed 42 (Good Physics, Flat Terrain)
- `unified_planet_seed_42.json` - Unified system output for seed 42
- `miniplanet_seed_42.json` - Original working seed 42 from runs/

**Contributed Features:**
- Smooth physics and jumping mechanics  
- High detail mesh (thousands of triangles)
- Working HUD and debug tools
- Clean system architecture

**Known Issues:**
- No terrain deformation (flat sphere)
- Broken sphere navigation (flat grid walking)
- Missing biome colors

### Seed 31415926 (Good Terrain, Broken Physics)  
- `MiniWorld_20250821_213628.json` - Working seed 31415926 metadata

**Contributed Features:**
- Working sphere navigation (full planet loops)
- Visual terrain deformation (hills raised/green, valleys depressed/grey)
- Surface object placement and pinning
- Biome color differentiation

**Known Issues:**
- Broken physics (teleport jumping)
- Gimbal lock near poles
- Physics-terrain collision mismatch
- Simple placeholder assets

## Integration Result

These seeds were combined into `unified_miniplanet.py` with fixes for:
- Terrain deformation (fixed divisionâ†’multiplication bug)
- Spherical navigation system
- Physics-terrain collision synchronization
- Cave system removal

The unified system now has the advantages of both seeds while fixing their critical issues.
