================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

StarSystem + The Forge represents a revolutionary AI-native programming language 
and game development ecosystem designed for ultra-compressed code generation by 
AI agents. The project combines a custom PCC (Procedural-Compressed-Code) language 
with a modular game engine and multi-agent evolution system to enable rapid 
creation of playable mini-planets with unlimited creative building capabilities.

PROJECT VISION
==============

Primary Goal: Create a system where "idea → playable mini-planet" workflows can 
be achieved through AI-assisted building tools, emphasizing unlimited creative 
time similar to Halo Forge mode, with grid-based building systems inspired by 
Terraria and Eco.

Core Philosophy:
- Deterministic, reproducible development with seed-based everything
- Local-first architecture (no cloud dependencies, MCP-only)
- Schema-driven validation with comprehensive error handling
- Human-in-the-loop validation for quality assurance
- Community-focused sharing with proper attribution and remix culture

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE
====================

1. PCC LANGUAGE & VM
   - Custom AST-based language eliminating parsing overhead
   - Standalone C++ interpreter (src/pcc_vm_simple.cpp)
   - Python runtime fallback in Forge engine
   - Direct AST programming for alien-like compression ratios

2. FORGE ENGINE (Modular Game Engine)
   - Hot-swappable module system (forge/modules/)
   - OpenGL-based 3D rendering with deterministic camera orbits
   - Physics simulation with optional realistic physics
   - PCC runtime integration for executing compressed games

3. AGENT EVOLUTION SYSTEM (A→D→B→C Cycle)
   - Agent A (Claude 3 Haiku): Fast code generator and prototyper
   - Agent D (Renderer): Converts PCC to 3D visual scenes
   - Agent B (GPT-4o): Quality assurance and validation testing
   - Agent C (Claude Sonnet 4): Strategic supervision and governance

4. MCP SERVER ARCHITECTURE
   - Complete tool registry: godot.*, generators.*, validators.*, builders.*
   - Deterministic seeding with global → world → tool → chip cascade
   - Schema validation for all inputs/outputs using URN-based IDs
   - Headless Godot integration with graceful fallback stubs
