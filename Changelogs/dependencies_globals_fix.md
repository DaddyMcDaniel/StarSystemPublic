# Dependencies & Global State Fix - Change Log
**Started**: 2025-08-24  
**Priority**: HIGH RISK remediation from Stage-1 cleanup  
**Scope**: Fix missing dependency management + refactor global state abuse

## CHANGE OBJECTIVES

### Issue 1: Missing Dependencies (HIGH RISK)
**Problem**: Critical libraries (numpy, PyOpenGL, PIL) have no version control
**Impact**: Unreproducible environments, potential breakage
**Evidence**: From `docs/sbom.json` and `docs/risk_register.md`

### Issue 2: Global State Abuse (HIGH RISK)  
**Problem**: 8+ global variables in cave rendering system
**File**: `agents/agent_d/marching_cubes/cave_viewer_extension.py:58,73,97,180,289,350,445,462`
**Impact**: Thread safety issues, difficult testing, state corruption

## PROGRESS TRACKING

### Phase 1: Dependencies Analysis (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Identify core dependencies from sbom.json
- [ ] Scan import patterns across all Python files
- [ ] Determine version ranges for stability
- [ ] Create requirements.txt with pinned versions

### Phase 2: Global State Refactor (PENDING)
- [ ] Analyze current global usage patterns
- [ ] Design CaveManager class architecture
- [ ] Implement class-based state management
- [ ] Test refactored system

## FINDINGS LOG

*Evidence will be captured here as work progresses*
